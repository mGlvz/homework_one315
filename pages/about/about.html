        Hi! My name is Monica. This is a space I created to share photos of my
        adventures and wildlife observations. Ever since I was a child I have
        been in awe of nature and its beauty. My hope is to capture that beauty
        and share it with the world. I mainly travel solo and explore nationally
        protected wilderness areas. These are the most remote and untouched
        pieces of land available to the public. My areas of interest are
        insects, bioluminescence, macro photography, wilderness areas, reptiles,
        birds of prey, fungus & lichen, and cave ecosystems.
